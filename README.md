# auto-ngtemplate-loader-test

Testbench for auto-ngtemplate-loader.

## Installation

Pull the package down and run `npm install` to install the dependencies.

## Running

You can then run `npm run build` to run the webpack build with `auto-ngtemplate-loader` added.

Additionally, to get a sense of what node version this package last built successfully on, check out the `.nvmrc` file. Usually, it will be pinned to the latest, or near latest, LTS version.

## Github actions

The repository has a single github action, which is linked above, which builds a sample bundle for Windows, macOS, and Linux, and the 3 latest Node.js versions.

The artifacts from that build are also uploaded so that you can compare the build artifacts.
